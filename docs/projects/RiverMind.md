# RiverMind Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

**RiverMind** is a machine learning project for river monitoring and risk assessment using hydrological data from Icon Water Limited stations.

### Locked Project Ideas

1. **Multi-Risk Assessment System**
   - Evaluate overall river health based on multiple parameters
   - Risk categories: Water quality, flood, drought, operational, environmental
   - Output: Risk scores (0-100) for different risk types

2. **Flood Risk Prediction** (Primary Focus)
   - Predict flood events using water level, discharge, and rainfall
   - Timeline: Nowcasting (0-3h), short-term (6-24h), medium-term (1-7 days)
   - Output: Flood probability or classification (No flood, Minor, Moderate, Major)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Pipeline

### Status: ✅ READY TO RUN

A production-level 7-stage cleaning pipeline has been created:

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Initial Assessment** - Data inventory and baseline metrics
2. **Quality Analysis** - Quality scoring and tier assignment
3. **Outlier Detection** - Multi-method outlier identification
4. **Gap Analysis** - Missing data patterns and interpolation
5. **Station Filtering** - Apply quality thresholds
6. **Data Cleaning** - Remove bad data, interpolate gaps
7. **Final Validation** - Validate and report

### Cleaning Criteria

**Automatic Removal:**
- Data before 2000
- Duplicate timestamps
- Excluded quality codes (255, -999)
- Physical impossibilities (negative values, extreme outliers)
- Excessive rate-of-change violations

**Station Exclusion:**
- Missing data >30%
- Synthetic data >50%
- Quality score <60
- Duration <1 year
- No recent data (last 2 years)
- Gaps >90 consecutive days

### Expected Output

**Data Tiers:**
- **Tier 1** (80-100 score): 50-100 files → Use for ML training
- **Tier 2** (60-79 score): 30-50 files → Use for validation
- **Tier 3** (40-59 score): 20-40 files → Use for testing

**Quality Improvement:**
- Missing data: 15-20% → 5-10%
- Outliers: 2-3% → <0.1%
- Synthetic data: 15% → <5%
- Record reduction: ~20-30%

## 🤖 Planned ML Models

### Phase 1: Flood Risk Prediction (Primary)

**Objective:** Predict flood events with 6-24 hour lead time

**Approach:**
- **Type**: Binary classification (flood/no flood) or multi-class (severity levels)
- **Features**: 
  - Current: Level, Discharge, Rainfall
  - Lag: Yesterday's values
  - Rolling: 3-day, 7-day cumulative rainfall
  - Rate: Rate of rise in level/discharge
  - Temporal: Month, season, day of year
  - Spatial: Upstream station data

**Models to Try:**
1. **XGBoost** (baseline) - Excellent for tabular data, handles imbalance
2. **Random Forest** - Robust, interpretable
3. **LSTM** - Captures temporal patterns
4. **Ensemble** - Combine tree-based + neural

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Precision (avoid false alarms)
- Recall (catch all floods)
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix

**Success Criteria:**
- Recall >90% (catch 90%+ of floods)
- Precision >70% (avoid too many false alarms)
- Lead time: 6-24 hours

### Phase 2: Multi-Risk Assessment (Secondary)

**Objective:** Comprehensive river health monitoring

**Risk Types:**
1. **Water Quality Risk** (turbidity-based)
2. **Flood Risk** (from Phase 1)
3. **Drought Risk** (low flow detection)
4. **Operational Risk** (infrastructure stress)

**Approach:**
- **Type**: Multi-output regression or multi-task learning
- **Output**: Risk scores (0-100) for each risk type
- **Features**: All 4 parameters + engineered features

**Models:**
- Multi-task neural network
- Separate models per risk type
- Ensemble approach

## 📊 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Data Scope
- **Decision**: Use data from 2000 onwards
- **Rationale**: Modern instrumentation, consistent protocols, relevant climate patterns

### 2. Quality Thresholds
- **Decision**: Max 30% missing, 50% synthetic, min score 60
- **Rationale**: Balance between data quality and quantity

### 3. Gap Handling
- **Decision**: Interpolate gaps ≤3 days, flag 4-7 days, don't interpolate >7 days
- **Rationale**: Small gaps reliable, large gaps introduce too much uncertainty

### 4. Project Priority
- **Decision**: Start with Flood Risk (Idea 2), then expand to Multi-Risk (Idea 1)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Clearer objective
  - Easier validation
  - Higher impact
  - Better data fit

### 5. Model Approach
- **Decision**: Start with XGBoost, then try LSTM, then ensemble
- **Rationale**: Iterative improvement, baseline first, complexity later
